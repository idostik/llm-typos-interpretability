# Tracing Typos in LLMs: My Attempt at Understanding How Models Correct Misspellings

### [See my LessWrong blogpost here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/523bkuMjSjKjG8jn6/tracing-typos-in-llms-my-attempt-at-understanding-how-models)

This repo contains code for my final project for Blue Dot Impacts AI Alignment course.

I tried to uncover how does typo correction work in LLMs and what are the key components that allow this ability. The jupyter notebook contains all of my code and steps that I took in order to uncover the underlying mechanisms in a rough, unpolished form.
